# Arquitetura_II

First project:

A processor with two communication channels, each one connected to a peripheral. 
- The two channels are unidirectional from the processor to the peripherals. 
- The two channels are 16 bits of data. The two channels operate simultaneously.
- Processor clock - 10ns 
- Peripheral clock 1 - 17 ns 
- Peripheral clock 2 - 8 ns

Output: FSM of the 3 devices and a verilog code to simulate the communication of the processor with the two peripherals.
